#' Declare or Delete Exchanges
#'
#' @description
#'
#' AMQP exchanges route messages to queues. By default the server will have a
#' few exchanges declared (including the default exchange \code{""}), but
#' additional exchanges can be declared and subsequently deleted by clients.
#'
#' Both \code{amqp_declare_exchange()} and \code{amqp_delete_exchange()} will
#' raise errors if there is a problem declaring/deleting the exchange.
#'
#' @param conn An object returned by \code{\link{amqp_connect}}.
#' @param exchange The name of an exchange.
#' @param type The type of exchange. Usually one of \code{"direct"},
#'   \code{"fanout"}, or \code{"topic"}.
#' @param passive When \code{TRUE}, raise an error if the exchange does not
#'   already exist.
#' @param durable When \code{TRUE}, the exchange will persist between server
#'   restarts.
#' @param auto_delete When \code{TRUE}, the exchange is automatically deleted
#'   when all queues have finished using it.
#' @param internal When \code{TRUE}, the exchange cannot be used for publishing
#'   messages; it can only be \link[=amqp_bindings]{bound} to other exchanges.
#'   This is for creating complex routing topologies that are not visible to
#'   consumers.
#' @param ... Additional arguments, used to declare broker-specific AMQP
#'   extensions. See \strong{Details}.
