# longears 0.2.2.9000

- `ampq_connect()` now takes a `name` parameter that allows users to set a
  connection name, which will appear in the RabbitMQ management plugin web
  interface and other supported UIs.

- The `print()` method for a connection will now print out all server and client
  properties for a connection when passed `full = TRUE`.

- Connections now set common client properties, which are visible in the
  RabbitMQ management plugin web interface.

# longears 0.2.2

- `amqp_publish()` will now accept raw vectors for the message body in addition
  to strings. (#4 by @dselivanov)

- Connections now set a heartbeat of 60 seconds. This should hopefully eliminate
  bugs where R would hang when trying to send messages to a closed socket
  (especially inside finalizers).

- Adds support for consumer cancel notifications, under which the RabbitMQ
  broker will send an appropriate message when e.g. a consumer's queue is
  deleted on the server side. The background thread will throw a warning,
  similar to how connection errors are currently surfaced. Prior to this,
  consumers would simply fall silent without a warning of any kind.

- Handling of closed connections on background threads has been improved.

# longears 0.2.1 (2019-08-28)

- First public release.

- Includes various improvements to top-level documentation.

# longears 0.2.0 (2019-07-19)

- Additional arguments can now be passed to exchange and queue declarations,
  consumers, and bindings, allowing users to employ most of RabbitMQ's
  extensions to the AMQP protocol.

- Additional arguments passed to `amqp_properties()` are now interpreted as
  custom message headers, with R types mapped to an appropriate AMQP field
  automatically.

- Exchange-to-exchange bindings are now available through `amqp_bind_exchange()`
  and `amqp_unbind_exchange()`.

- Temporary queues now default to `exclusive = FALSE`. This is a much more
  sensible choice, but a breaking change.

- The background thread now checks messages at much higher frequency: 100 Hz
  instead of 1 Hz. This means that `consume_later()` is no longer limited to
  ingesting 1 message per second -- it can now handle as many as 100.

# longears 0.1.3 (2019-07-15)

- Fixes a C-level namespace collision with `connect(2)` that could result in
  the wrong function being used by the linker.

# longears 0.1.2 (2019-07-10)

- Connection objects will no longer attempt to automatically reconnect. Instead,
  they will surface an error for the user. This is because "automatic"
  reconnection has turned out to be a bit dishonest: connections have state --
  exclusive or auto-deleting queues and exchanges, plus consumers -- that will
  be lost during disconnections. Thus, the user must be informed about these
  events so that they can properly restore the expected state.

- Internal handling of server/socket issues has dramatically improved. These
  errors will now be identified earlier and reported in a much less cryptic
  manner. Users will also be warned about lost consumers, either during
  reconnection for the foreground consumers or via a **later** callback for
  background consumers.

- Consumers will now set a prefetch count of 50 automatically and attempt to
  acknowledge all messages even if the callback fails (unless they are in
  `no_ack` mode).

# longears 0.1.1 (2019-06-20)

- Tests requiring a local RMQ server will now be skipped unless one is detected.

- Fixes an issue where `amqp_properties()` would not handle missing names
  correctly.

- Fixes an issue where connection errors could sometimes encounter uninitialized
  memory.

# longears 0.1.0 (2019-06-06)

- First alpha release.

- Allows for connecting to RMQ servers via `amqp_connect()` and
  `amqp_disconnect()`. Reconnections required by protocol errors are handled
  automatically, and AMQP channels are managed internally by the connection
  objects. Most other functions require passing a valid connection object.

- Implements a subset of the AMQP feature set, including:

  - Declaring and deleting exchanges and queues via `amqp_declare_exchange()`,
    `amqp_delete_queue()`, etc.
  - Binding queues to (and unbind them from) exchanges via `amqp_bind_queue()`
    and `amqp_unbind_queue()`.
  - Publishing messages to exchanges via `amqp_publish()`.
  - Encoding/decoding AMQP basic properties via `amqp_properties()`.
  - Retrieving individual messages from queues via `amqp_get()`. This is the
    "polling" interface.
  - Consuming many messages from queues using a combination of `amqp_consume()`
    and `amqp_listen()`. This is the "push" interface.

- Also includes an experimental `amqp_consume_later()` function for
  "asynchronous" message handling. Requires that the user has an event loop
  compatible with the **later** package, such as a Shiny application.
