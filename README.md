<!-- badges: end -->

**longears** is a fast and fully-featured RabbitMQ client for R, built
on top of the reference C library,
[`librabbitmq`](https://github.com/alanxz/rabbitmq-c).

[RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) itself is a highly popular,
performant, and robust open-source message broker used to build
distributed systems.

**longears** implements a large portion of the Advanced Message Queuing
Protocol (AMQP) used by RabbitMQ , and the API largely reflects [the
protocol itself](https://www.rabbitmq.com/amqp-0-9-1-reference.html).
However, this package is not a true low-level interface: it abstracts
away many details of AMQP for end users. See [Limitations](#Limitations)
for details.

This package may be of interest to you if you wish to have R speak to
your organizationâ€™s existing RabbitMQ servers; if you simply need a
message queue library, you may be better off with
[**txtq**](https://cran.r-project.org/package=txtq),
[**litq**](https://cran.r-project.org/package=liteq), or the ZeroMQ
package [**rzmq**](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rzmq).

## Installation

To install **longears** as a source package you will need its system dependency,
`librabbitmq`. Normally if this library is missing during installation, the
`configure` script will attempt to download and build it directly (provided you
have `cmake` installed).

You may still wish to use your platform's provided `librabbitmq` instead,
especially if this process fails. On Debian-based systems (including Ubuntu) you
can get this library by running the following from the command line:

``` shell
$ apt install librabbitmq-dev
```

For other platforms:

  - macOS (via Homebrew): `brew install rabbitmq-c`
  - Fedora-based: `yum install librabbitmq-devel`
  - Arch-based: `pacman -S librabbitmq-c`
  - Windows (via [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/)):
    `pacman -Sy mingw-w64-{i686,x86_64}-rabbitmq-c`

You can then install **longears** from CRAN with

``` r
install.packages("longears")
```

or from GitHub with

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("atheriel/longears")
```

## Basic Usage

If you are not already familiar with RabbitMQ and the
message/queue/binding/exchange terminology, I suggest their excellent
[conceptual
overview](https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/amqp-concepts.html).

You will also need to have a local RabbitMQ server running with the
default settings to follow this guide.

``` shell
$ # apt install rabbitmq-server
$ systemctl start rabbitmq-server
$ rabbitmqctl status
```

First, connect to the server (with the default settings):

``` r
conn <- amqp_connect()
conn
#> AMQP Connection:
#>   status:  connected
#>   address: localhost:5672
#>   vhost:   '/'
```

Create an exchange to route messages and a couple of queues to store
them:

``` r
amqp_declare_exchange(conn, "my.exchange", type = "fanout")
amqp_declare_queue(conn, "my.queue1")
#> AMQP queue 'my.queue1'
#>   messages:  0
#>   consumers: 0
amqp_declare_queue(conn, "my.queue2")
#> AMQP queue 'my.queue2'
#>   messages:  0
#>   consumers: 0
amqp_bind_queue(conn, "my.queue1", "my.exchange", routing_key = "#")
amqp_bind_queue(conn, "my.queue2", "my.exchange", routing_key = "#")
```

You can also set up a consumer for one of these queues with a callback:

``` r
received <- 0
consumer <- amqp_consume(conn, "my.queue2", function(msg) {
  received <<- received + 1
})
```

Now, send a few messages to this exchange:

``` r
amqp_publish(conn, "first", exchange = "my.exchange", routing_key = "#")
amqp_publish(conn, "second", exchange = "my.exchange", routing_key = "#")
```

Check if your messages are going into the queues:

``` shell
$ rabbitmqctl list_queues
```

You can use `amqp_get()` to pull individual messages back into R:

``` r
amqp_get(conn, "my.queue1")
#> Delivery Tag:    1
#> Redelivered: FALSE
#> Exchange:    my.exchange
#> Routing Key: #
#> Message Count:   1
#> 66 69 72 73 74
amqp_get(conn, "my.queue1")
#> Delivery Tag:    2
#> Redelivered: FALSE
#> Exchange:    my.exchange
#> Routing Key: #
#> Message Count:   0
#> 73 65 63 6f 6e 64
amqp_get(conn, "my.queue1")
#> character(0)
```

Or you can use `amqp_listen()` to run consumer callbacks:

``` r
amqp_listen(conn, timeout = 1)
received
#> [1] 2
```

To clean things up, delete the queues, the exchange, and disconnect from
the server.

``` r
amqp_delete_queue(conn, "my.queue1")
amqp_delete_queue(conn, "my.queue2")
amqp_delete_exchange(conn, "my.exchange")
amqp_disconnect(conn)
conn
#> AMQP Connection:
#>   status:  disconnected
#>   address: localhost:5672
#>   vhost:   '/'
```

And check that the connection is closed:

``` shell
$ rabbitmqctl list_connections
```

## Limitations

Some AMQP features are not present, notably transaction support (which
there are no plans to implement). Others are not exposed through the API
but are handled internally according to best practices: channels,
message acknowledgements, and prefetch counts, among others. The current
design goal of the package is to keep these details from the eyes of
users, insofar as that is possible.

If you have need of an AMQP feature (or RabbitMQ extension) that is not
currently available or accessible, please consider filing an issue
explaining the use case you have in mind.
